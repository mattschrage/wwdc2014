I was a Software Engineer at a startup called Rockmelt last summer (June - July 2013). I worked jointly with the Design and Engineering teams to prototype new features for the app. Yahoo bought the company, while I was there so the internship was cut a little short. However it was a really valuable experience to work at an actual company and it was very cool to see an acquisition take place.

This summer, I was offered an internship at Pocket to help them with their iOS app.
