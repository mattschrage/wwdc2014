I go to San Francisco University High School. I am a currently a Junior. I have taken numerous independent studies in topics ranging from Journalism to Robotics.

This year I have been the T.A. for the AP Computer Science class and have had the opportunity to help teach students to program for the first time.

In addition to the T.A. position, I take AP US History, Pre-Calculus, Microbiology, Spanish Lit., and Literature of California.

My favorite class of all time as widely considered the most challening course at the school: Western Civilization (refered to as Civ by those who make it though üòÅ). The course traced Western culture from the Archaic Age of Greece to the contemporary, combining the event based history with the artistic and musical style periods. I learned about topics ranging from Goya's 'Saturn Devouring His Childeren' to Marc Rothko's abstract expressionism, from Motzart's Symphony No. 20 to Schoenbergs' atonal song cycles.
